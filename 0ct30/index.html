#first we’ll load our libraries library(tidyverse) library(lubridate)

run this to load the data for this assignment
it will create a dataframe called “impeach,” with all House Democrats
impeach <- read_csv(“https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRh8d5JaDqBtByzNw2JZF3idaACobDhhk-p7chJoktA0HawELHFOvjQOqCpzGA4MGONvPlR7GASqW-K/pub?gid=1765341510&single=true&output=csv”)

FOR EACH OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW, WRITE YOUR WORKING R CODE TO RETURN THE REQUESTED RESULTS
USE COMMENTS (PREFACED BY THE #) BEFORE THE WORKING CODE TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU’RE DOING FOR EACH STEP
1) The column “for_impeachment” indicates whether the member has publicly called for
an impeachment inquiry. Filter to return only the ones where the answer is NO.
view data, then filter and check impeachment for “NO”
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,for_impeachment == “NO”)

2) Filter to return only results where a member is both against impeachment, and comes from a
district that President Trump won in 2016 (which is noted in the “p16winningparty” column)
viewed data and inserted two conditions
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,for_impeachment == “NO”,p16winningparty == “R”)

3) Filter for only results where a member is against impeachment, comes from a
district that President Trump won in 2016 (which is noted in the “p16winningparty” column),
and also comes from a district that Mitt Romney won in 2012 (“p12winningparty”).
view data, added additional condition checking “p12winningparty” was also “R”
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,for_impeachment == “NO”,p16winningparty == “R”,p12winningparty == “R”)

4) Filter for only results from September 2019 where a member is a YES for impeachment.
view data, filter column date/month = “9” and year “2019”
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,date_month == “9”,date_year == “2019”)

4) Filter for only results where a member is a YES for impeachment and is from a district
where Clinton won more than 70 percent of the vote in 2016 (found in column “clinton_percent”)
view data, insert for impeachment and clinton’s percentage either = to or > than 70%
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1, for_impeachment == “YES”, clinton_percent>=70)

5) Sort the entire dataframe based on the percentage of a district that has a
bachelor’s degree or higher (“pct_bachelors”), from lowest to highest
view data, use arrange function for “pct_bachelors” for lowest value first
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) arrange(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,(pct_bachelors))

6) Sort the just those who are NO on impeachment based on the percentage of a district that has a
bachelor’s degree or higher (“pct_bachelors”), from lowest to highest
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) arrange(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,(pct_bachelors)) newdata = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1, for_impeachment ==

7) Sort the just those who are NO on impeachment based on the percentage of a district that has a
bachelor’s degree or higher (“pct_bachelors”), from lowest to highest.
Then filter those records by only those whose bachelor’s percentage is below the national average (found
in the “pct_bachelors_compared_to_national” column).
8) Filter for only members from New Jersey who are NO on impeachment
view data, check for state of NJ who are “NO” for impeachment
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1, state == “NJ”, for_impeachment == “NO”)

9) Filter for those who were YES on impeachment, with a declared date prior to 2019. So only
those with dates before 2019. Then sort those so that the highest Clinton vote percentages are
at the top.
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) newdata<-filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1, for_impeachment == “YES”, date_year<2019) arrange((desc(clinton_percent))

10) Answer this question with a single numeric answer, and show the R code you
used to reach that answer: How many members in the dataset who are holdouts on impeachment
comes from districts with a GDP below the national figure?
view(joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1) filter(.data = joined_impeachment_0927_Sheet1,for_impeachment == “NO”, gdp_above_national == “BELOW”)
